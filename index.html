	<h1>Meet... Ashley Cahalan</h1>

		<h3>Hi, my name is Ashley! I live in London, ON and was born and raised here. I have one sibling, a younger brother, who is currently studying at Guelph University. I enjoy travelling (I have a family that loves to travel), learning the guitar, biking, hiking and being outdoors.</h3>

		<h3>I studied Criminology and French at King’s University College at Western University and graduated this past June. For the past few years, I have loved playing intramural flag football, as well as running the Canadian Cancer Society’s post-secondary Relay For Life program at King’s.</h3>

		<h3>Currently, I am a student in the Interactive Media Design program at Fanshawe College. I am looking forward to this new and exciting semester!</h3>
